== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Yes. You can get 100% of your money back within 10 days of your subscription if you are not satisfied with our product. We want to ensure our customers have a superior service.

= Do you provide annual plans? =

Yes. Although we only provide a 3-month plan listed in our package, we can also give you annual plan package at your request. We will provide the separate data usage over a year instead of a month to month data accumulation. Contact us any time at support@ecomfit.com for further details.

= Can I change my plan later or cancel anytime? =


Definitely. You can upgrade or downgrade your plan to suit your needs and also cancel the plan anytime. Just simply contact us for assistance.

= What if I exceed my plan’s limit? =

No worries, we will not stop collecting your data. Once you exceed your plan’s monthly limit, you’ll receive an email asking you to upgrade to the appropriate package. You can view your data again after the upgrade.

= What kind of ecommerce platforms & websites do you support? =

Due to the flexibility of our system, Ecomfit easily integrates with all custom websites and compatible with any Ecommerce Platform like Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, etc… The installation process happens in a matter of minutes and few clicks.

= Can I handle multiple sites with one account? =

Yes. However, each plan can only be used for 1 website with a distinct domain which means if you want to handle another website you need to pay for a new plan.

= How do i integrate with my site? =

There are two kinds of websites which are handled differently. For custom websites you need to go through manual configuration by embedding our JS code to your website before the tag. For E-commerce platforms like Shopify just access your marketplace for automatic integration.
